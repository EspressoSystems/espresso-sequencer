/// An interface for querying a HotShot blockchain.
///
/// This interface provides expressive queries over all the data which is made available by HotShot
/// consensus. The data exposed by this interface consists entirely of _normative_ data: data which
/// every correct HotShot node or light client will agree on, and which is guaranteed by consensus
/// to be immutable. This immutability has an interesting consequence: all of the methods exposed by
/// this trait are _pure_: given equivalent inputs, the same method will always return equivalent
/// outputs[^1].
///
/// This purity property has a further consequence: none of the methods defined here can fail! Even
/// if you query for a block at a position past the end of the current chain -- a block which does
/// not exist yet -- the query will not fail. It will return an in-progress [`Fetch`] which, when it
/// finally does resolve, resolves to the unique block at that position in the chain. All subsequent
/// queries for the same position will eventually resolve to the same block.
///
/// In other words, the abstraction is that of an infinitely long chain which exists statically, in
/// its entirety, at all times. In reality, of course, this chain is being produced incrementally
/// and has a finite length at any given time. But all this means is that some queries may take a
/// long time to resolve while others may resolve immediately.
///
/// [^1]: The data returned by these methods are wrapped in [`Fetch`], which does not implement
///       [`PartialEq]`. So to speak of equivalent outputs, we need to define an equivalence
///       relation on [`Fetch<T>`]. The relation we will use is defined when `T: PartialEq`, and
///       defines two fetches `f1` and `f2` as equivalent when `f1.await == f2.await`. That is,
///       depending on when you call a certain method, you may or may not get a response
///       immediately. But whenever you do get the data you requested, it is unique for that
///       combination of inputs.
