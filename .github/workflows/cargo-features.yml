      # Note: this job doesn't use a cache on purpose because it mostly compiles
      # the crates in this repo over and over again with different feature
      # combinations. Adding caching would not speed it up much and further
      # contribute to our cache usage.

      # Includes checks for `--no-default-features` and `--all-features` as well
      # as each individual feature enabled.
