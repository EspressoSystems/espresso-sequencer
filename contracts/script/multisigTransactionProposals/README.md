# Proposing Multisig Transactions via the Safe SDK

The [Safe SDK](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md) is being
used to propose transactions that only the Safe multisig admin wallet can perform. The proposer of these transactions is
also part of the multisig wallet but is used to orchestrate the process. E.g. If you require 3 of 5 trusted signers to
sign a transaction, then the multisig wallet should require 4 of 5 signers where the 4th signer is the orchestrator
wallet.

## Pre-requisites

- You have node installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Create a Multisig Wallet

Assuming you don't have a Safe Multisig already. Ensure that the following environment variables are set in the
`.env.contracts` file:

- `RPC_URL`
- `USE_HARDWARE_WALLET` (if yes, put "true", otherwise "false")
- - if false, then also set the `SAFE_ORCHESTRATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `SAFE_SIGNERS_LIST`
- `SAFE_SIGNER_THRESHOLD`

Assuming you're in the root folder, run the following command:

```bash
source .env.contracts && \
ts-node contracts/script/multisigTransactionProposals/safeSDK/createMultisigWallet.ts
```

## List Pending Transaction Proposals

Anyone can view transaction proposals for a multisig wallet. Ensure that the following environment variables are set in
the `.env.contracts` file:

- `RPC_URL`
- `SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`
- `SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`

Assuming you're in the root folder, run the following command:

```bash
source .env.contracts && \
ts-node contracts/script/multisigTransactionProposals/safeSDK/viewPendingTxnProposals.ts
```

## Set Permissioned Prover

To enable the permissioned prover on the light client contract, ensure that the following environment variables are set
in the `.env.contracts` file:

- `RPC_URL`
- `SAFE_ORCHESTRATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` (if not using a hardware wallet)
- `SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`
- `PERMISSIONED_PROVER_ADDRESS`
- `LIGHT_CLIENT_CONTRACT_PROXY_ADDRESS`
- `USE_HARDWARE_WALLET` (if yes, put "true", otherwise "false")

> **_NOTE:_** the signer for this transaction must be one of the signers in the **Safe Multisig Wallet**, whether the
> ledger hardware wallet or the address owned by `SAFE_ORCHESTRATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`

Assuming you're in the root folder, run the following command:

```bash
source .env.contracts && \
ts-node contracts/script/multisigTransactionProposals/safeSDK/modifyProverModeProposal.ts setProver
```

Open the the URL shown in the console to sign the transaction in the Safe UI.

Once successful, all signers will see a transaction request on the SAFE UI e.g.
`https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=$SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`

Once the transaction has been signed by all signers and executed by one, you should be able to go to the light client
proxy and read the permissioned prover address on etherscan.

## Disable Permissioned Prover

To disable the permissioned prover on the light client contract, ensure that the following environment variables are set
in the `.env.contracts` file:

- `RPC_URL`
- `SAFE_ORCHESTRATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` (if not using a hardware wallet)
- `SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`
- `LIGHT_CLIENT_CONTRACT_PROXY_ADDRESS`
- `USE_HARDWARE_WALLET` (if yes, put "true", otherwise "false")

Assuming you're in the root folder, run the following command:

```bash
source .env.contracts && \
ts-node contracts/script/multisigTransactionProposals/safeSDK/modifyProverModeProposal.ts disableProver
```

Once successful, all signers will see a transaction request on the SAFE UI
`https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=$SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`

Once the transaction has been signed by all signers and executed by one, you should be able to go to the light client
proxy and read the permissioned prover address. It will be equal to the 0 ETH address (address(0)).

## Set the state history retention period

To enable the state history retention period on the light client contract, ensure that the following environment
variables are set in the `.env` file:

- `RPC_URL`
- `SAFE_ORCHESTRATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` (if not using a hardware wallet)
- `SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`
- `LIGHT_CLIENT_CONTRACT_PROXY_ADDRESS`
- `STATE_HISTORY_RETENTION_PERIOD`
- `USE_HARDWARE_WALLET` (if yes, put "true", otherwise "false")

Assuming you're in the root folder, run the following command:

```bash
source .env.contracts && \
ts-node contracts/script/multisigTransactionProposals/safeSDK/modifyStateHistoryRetentionPeriod.ts
```

Open the the URL shown in the console to sign the transaction in the Safe UI.

Once successful, all signers will see a transaction request on the SAFE UI e.g.
`https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=$SAFE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS`

Once the transaction has been signed by all signers and executed by one, you should be able to go to the light client
proxy and read the state history retention period on etherscan.

## Demonstrating the setPermissionedProver workflow

1. Follow the steps in the deployment script [readme](../../contracts/script/README.md) to set up a Multisig Wallet and
   deploy the Light Client contract
2. Set the environment variables mentioned in the section, [Set Permissioned Prover](#set-permissioned-prover)
3. Run the `ts-node` command as mentioned in the section, [Set Permissioned Prover](#set-permissioned-prover)

## Demonstrating the disablePermissionedProver workflow

1. Follow the steps in the deployment script [readme](../../contracts/script/README.md) to set up a Multisig Wallet and
   deploy the Light Client contract
2. Set the environment variables mentioned in the section, [Disable Permissioned Prover](#disable-permissioned-prover)
3. Run the `ts-node` command as mentioned in the section, [Disable Permissioned Prover](#disable-permissioned-prover)

## Testing

### Testing Safe Multisig Wallets

The Safe Transaction Service requires a live network available for testing and the current service only supports mainnet
and testnets such as Sepolia. The Safe Wallet UI only works with public networks that they support and to customize it
for a private EVM network, read their [docs](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40795-supported-networks) for more
info. It's non-trivial to set up Safe for private networks and therefore time has not been allocated to do so at this
stage.

### Testing the utils

Testing safeSDK/utils.ts

```bash
yarn jest contracts/script/multisigTransactionProposals/tests/utils.test.ts
```

OR

```bash
yarn jest
```
