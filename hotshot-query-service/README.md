# HotShot Query Service

The HotShot Query Service is a minimal, generic query service that can be integrated into any
decentralized application running on the [HotShot](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/HotShot)
consensus layer. It provides all the features that HotShot itself expects of a query service (such
as providing consensus-related data for catchup and synchronization) as well as some
application-level features that deal only with consensus-related or application-agnostic data. In
addition, the query service is provided as an extensible library, which makes it easy to add
additional, application-specific features (such as a JSON-RPC service in the case of an EVM
application).

## Features

- Provides a query interface to a persistent store containing the history of a blockchain
  (represented as a chain of HotShot
  [leaves](https://hotshot.docs.espressosys.com/hotshot_types/data/struct.Leaf.html))
- Provides a query interface for validator status and metrics
- Integrates with HotShot to populate the persistent database
- Generic over application types (within a leaf, the block and block commitment can be any type the
  application specifieds)
- Transparently handles asynchronous data availability &mdash; block commitments are provided as
  soon as they are committed by consensus; block data is provided once it has disseminated from the
  data availability committee; missing data is fetched asynchronously from other nodes
- Serves as a source of data for HotShot catchup
- Easily extensible with application-specific functionality

## Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EspressoSystems/hotshot-query-service
cd hotshot-query-service
```

### Environment

We recommend installing dependencies with the [nix](https://nixos.org) package manager, which will
ensure you use the same Rust version and related tools as everyone else using a Nix environment
(including the CI system). If you prefer not to use Nix, you should still be able to build the
project with the normal [rustup](https://rustup.rs)-installed toolchain, and you can skip this
section.

#### Install nix

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://nixos.org/download.html). If in a rush,
running the following command and following the on-screen instructions should work in most cases

```bash
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

#### Activate the nix environment

To activate a shell with the development environment run

```bash
nix-shell
```

from within the top-level directory of the repo.

Note: for the remainder of this README it is necessary that this environment is active.

#### direnv (optional, but recommended for development)

To avoid manually activating the nix shell each time, the [direnv](https://direnv.net/) shell
extension can be used to activate the environment when entering the local directory of this repo.
Note that direnv needs to be [hooked](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) into the shell to function.

To enable `direnv` run

```bash
direnv allow
```

from the root directory of this repo.

### Building and testing

Once you have Cargo installed (either via Nix or Rustup) you can build the project with
`cargo build` or `cargo build --release`. To run unit tests, we recommend using

```bash
cargo nextest run --release --all-features
```

You can also run unit tests using the development profile, but without the optimizations of the
release profile, some stack sizes exceed the default Rust stack. Therefore, you will need to
configure a default stack size to run the development build. 3MB seems to work well:

```bash
RUST_MIN_STACK=3145728 cargo nextest run --all-features
```

#### Doctest

Doctests require the `testing` feature. Due to a [limitation of doctest](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55727482) it is recommended to run doctests via

```bash
cargo nextest run --doc --features testing
```
