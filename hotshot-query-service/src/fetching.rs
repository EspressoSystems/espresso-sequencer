//! Fetching missing data from remote providers.
//!
//! This module provides a mechanism to fetch data that is missing from this query service's storage
//! from a remote data availability provider. [`Fetcher`] can be used to handle concurrent requests
//! for data, ensuring that each distinct resource is only fetched once at a time.
//!
//! Fetching is ultimately dispatched to a [`Provider`], which implements fetching for a specific
//! type of resource from a specific source. The [`provider`] module contains built-in
//! implementations of [`Provider`] for various data availability sources.

/// reconstruct a block. Or, we may fetch the same payload for two different blocks. In both of
/// these cases, there are two objects that must be processed and stored after the fetch completes.
///
/// In these cases, we only want one task to actually fetch the resource, but there may be several
/// unrelated actions to take after the resource is fetched. This trait allows us to identify a
