//! Data for the [`node`](super) API.
//!
//! This module is just an alternative view of the same data provided by the
//! [`availability`](crate::availability) API. It provides more insight into what data the node
//! actually has at present, as opposed to trying to present a perfect view of an abstract chain,
//! fetching data from other sources as needed. It is also more liberal with provided aggregate
//! counts and statistics which may be inaccurate if data is missing.
//!
//! Due to this relationship with the availability module, this module has its own [data source
//! trait](`NodeDataSource`) but not its own update trait. The node data source is expected to read
//! its data from the same underlying database as the availability API, and as such the data is
//! updated implicitly via the [availability API update
//! trait](crate::availability::UpdateAvailabilityData).
