//! Asynchronous fetching from external data availability providers.
//!
//! Occasionally, data will be missing from the local persistent storage of this query service. This
//! may be because the query service never received the data from the attached HotShot instance,
//! which happens for each block payload committed while the attached HotShot instance is not a
//! member of the DA committee. It may also be because the query service was started some time after
//! the start of consensus, and needs to catch up on existing data. Or it may simply be a result of
//! failures in the local storage medium.
//!
//! In any case, the query service is able to fetch missing data asynchronously and out of
//! chronological order, and pending [`Fetch`](crate::availability::Fetch) requests for the missing
//! data will resolve as soon as the data is available. Data can be fetched from any external data
//! availability service, including the HotShot CDN, the data availability committee which is
//! responsible for providing a particular payload, or another instance of this same query service.
//!
//! This module defines an abstract interface [`Provider`], which allows data to be fetched from any
//! data availability provider, as well as various implementations for different data sources,
//! including:
//! * [`QueryServiceProvider`]
//!
//! We also provide combinators for modularly adding functionality to existing fetchers:
//! * [`AnyProvider`]
//! * [`TestProvider`]
//!
