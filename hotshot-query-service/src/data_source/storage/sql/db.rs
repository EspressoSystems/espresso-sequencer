/// The underlying database type for a SQL data source.
///
/// Currently, only PostgreSQL and SQLite are supported, with selection based on the "embedded-db" feature flag.
/// - When the "embedded-db" feature is enabled, SQLite is used.
/// - When itâ€™s disabled, PostgreSQL is used.
///
/// ### Design Choice
/// The reason for taking this approach over sqlx's Any database is that we can support SQL types
/// which are implemented for the two backends we care about (Postgres and SQLite) but not for _any_
/// SQL database, such as MySQL. Crucially, JSON types fall in this category.
///
/// The reason for taking this approach rather than writing all of our code to be generic over the
/// Database implementation is that sqlx does not have the necessary trait bounds on all of the
/// associated types (e.g. Database::Connection does not implement Executor for all possible
/// databases, the Executor impl lives on each concrete connection type) and Rust does not provide
/// a good way of encapsulating a collection of trait bounds on associated types. Thus, our function
/// signatures become untenably messy with bounds like
///
/// ```rust
/// # use sqlx::{Database, Encode, Executor, IntoArguments, Type};
/// fn foo<DB: Database>()
/// where
///     for<'a> &'a mut DB::Connection: Executor<'a>,
///     for<'q> DB::Arguments<'q>: IntoArguments<'q, DB>,
///     for<'a> i64: Type<DB> + Encode<'a, DB>,
/// {}
/// ```
