/// This trait allows us to carry around hetergenous lists of parameters (e.g. tuples) and bind them
/// to a query at the last moment before executing. This means we can manipulate the parameters
/// independently of the query before executing it. For example, by requiring a trait bound of
/// `Params<'p> + Clone`, we get a list (or tuple) of parameters which can be cloned and then bound
/// to a query, which allows us to keep a copy of the parameters around in order to retry the query
/// if it fails.

///
/// A SQL [`Query`] with lifetime `'q` borrows from both it's SQL statement (`&'q str`) and its
/// parameters (bound via `bind<'q>`). Sometimes, though, it is necessary for the statement and its
/// parameters to have different (but overlapping) lifetimes. For example, the parameters might be
/// passed in and owned by the caller, while the query string is constructed in the callee and its
/// lifetime is limited to the callee scope. (See for example the [`upsert`](Transaction::upsert)
/// function which does exactly this.)
///
/// We could rectify this situation with a trait bound like `P: for<'q> Params<'q>`, meaning `P`
/// must be bindable to a query with a lifetime chosen by the callee. However, when `P` is an
/// associated type, such as an element of an iterator, as in
/// `<I as IntoIter>::Item: for<'q> Params<'q>`, [a current limitation](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization.html#implied-static-requirement-from-higher-ranked-trait-bounds.)
/// in the Rust compiler then requires `P: 'static`, which we don't necessarily want: the caller
/// should be able to pass in a reference to avoid expensive cloning.
///
/// So, instead, we work around this by making it explicit in the [`Params`] trait that the lifetime
/// of the query we're binding to (`'q`) may be different than the lifetime of the parameters (`'p`)
