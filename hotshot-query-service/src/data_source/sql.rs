/// A data source for the APIs provided in this crate, backed by a remote PostgreSQL database.
///
/// # Administration
///
/// This data source will automatically connect to and perform queries on a remote SQL database.
/// However, _administration_ of the database, such as initialization, resetting, and backups, is
/// left out of the scope of this implementation, and is expected to be performed manually using
/// off-the-shelf DBMS administration tools. The one exception is migrations, which are handled
/// transparently by the [`SqlDataSource`].
///
/// ## Schema
///
/// All the objects created and used by [`SqlDataSource`] are grouped under a schema for easy
/// management. By default, the schema is named `hotshot`, and is created the first time a
/// [`SqlDataSource`] is constructed. The name of the schema can be configured by setting
/// [`Config::schema`].
///
/// ## Initialization
///
/// When creating a PostgreSQL [`SqlDataSource`], the caller can use [`Config`] to specify the host, user, and
/// database for the connection. If the `embedded-db` feature is enabled, the caller can instead specify the
/// file path for an SQLite database.
/// As such, [`SqlDataSource`] is not very opinionated about how the
/// database instance is set up. The administrator must simply ensure that there is a database
/// dedicated to the [`SqlDataSource`] and a user with appropriate permissions (all on `SCHEMA` and
/// all on `DATABASE`) over that database.
///
/// Here is an example of how a sufficient database could be initialized. When using the standard
/// `postgres` Docker image, these statements could be placed in
/// `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql` to automatically initialize the database upon startup.
///
/// ```sql
/// CREATE DATABASE hotshot_query_service;
/// \connect hotshot_query_service;
/// CREATE USER hotshot_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
/// GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO hotshot_user;
/// GRANT ALL ON DATABASE hotshot_query_service TO hotshot_user WITH GRANT OPTION;
/// ```
///
/// For SQLite, simply provide the file path, and the file will be created if it does not already exist.
///
/// One could then connect to this database with the following [`Config`] for postgres:
///
/// ```
/// # use hotshot_query_service::data_source::sql::Config;
/// #[cfg(not(feature= "embedded-db"))]
/// Config::default()
///     .host("postgres.database.hostname")
///     .database("hotshot_query_service")
///     .user("hotshot_user")
///     .password("password")
/// # ;
/// ```
/// Or, if the `embedded-db` feature is enabled, configure it as follows for SQLite:
///
/// ```
/// # use hotshot_query_service::data_source::sql::Config;
/// #[cfg(feature= "embedded-db")]
/// Config::default()
///     .db_path("temp.db".into())
/// # ;
/// ```
/// ## Resetting
///
/// In general, resetting the database when necessary is left up to the administrator. However, for
/// convenience, we do provide a [`reset_schema`](Config::reset_schema) option which can be used to
/// wipe out existing state and create a fresh instance of the query service. This is particularly
/// useful for development and staging environments. This function will permanently delete all
/// tables associated with the schema used by this query service, but will not reset other schemas
/// or database.
///
/// ## Migrations
///
/// For the [`SqlDataSource`] to work, the database must be initialized with the appropriate schema,
/// and the schema must be kept up to date when deploying a new version of this software which
/// depends on a different schema. Both of these tasks are accomplished via _migrations_.
///
/// Each release of this software is bundled with a sequence of migration files: one migration for
/// each release that changed the schema, including the latest one. Replaying these SQL files
/// against a database with an older version of the schema, including a completely empty database,
/// will bring it up to date with the schema required by this version of the software. Upon creating
/// an instance of [`SqlDataSource`] and connecting to a database, the data source will
/// automatically fetch the current version from the database and, if it is old, replay the
/// necessary migration files.
///
/// ## Custom Migrations
///
/// In keeping with the philosophy of this crate, [`SqlDataSource`] is designed to be
/// [extensible and composable](#extension-and-composition). When extending the provided APIs with
/// new, application-specific queries, it will often be desirable to alter the schema of the
/// database in some way, such as adding additional columns to some of the tables or creating new
/// indices. When composing the provided APIs with additional API modules, it may also be desirable
/// to alter the schema, although the changes are more likely to be completely independent of the
/// schema used by this data source, such as adding entirely new tables.
///
/// In either case, the default schema can be modified by inserting additional migrations between
/// the migrations distributed with this crate. The new migrations will then automatically be
/// replayed as necessary when initializing a [`SqlDataSource`]. New custom migrations can be
/// added with each software update, to keep the custom data up to date as the default schema
/// changes.
///
/// Custom migrations can be inserted using [`Config::migrations`]. Each custom migration will be
/// inserted into the overall sequence of migrations in order of version number. The migrations
/// provided by this crate only use version numbers which are multiples of 100, so the non-multiples
/// can be used to insert custom migrations between the default migrations. You can also replace a
/// default migration completely by providing a custom migration with the same version number. This
/// may be useful when an earlier custom migration has altered the schema in such a way that a later
/// migration no longer works as-is. However, this technique is error prone and should be used only
/// when necessary.
///
/// When using custom migrations, it is the user's responsibility to ensure that the resulting
/// schema is compatible with the schema expected by [`SqlDataSource`]. Adding things (tables,
/// columns, indices) should usually be safe. Removing, altering, or renaming things should be done
/// with extreme caution.
///
/// It is standard to store custom migrations as SQL files in a sub-directory of the crate. For ease
/// of release and deployment, such directories can be embedded into a Rust binary and parsed into
/// a list of [`Migration`] objects using the [`include_migrations`] macro.
///
/// It is also possible to take complete control over migrating the schema using
/// [`Config::no_migrations`] to prevent the [`SqlDataSource`] from running its own migrations. The
/// database administrator then becomes responsible for manually migrating the database, ensuring the
/// schema is up to date, and ensuring that the schema is at all times compatible with the schema
/// expected by the current version of this software. Nevertheless, this may be the best option when
/// your application-specific schema has diverged significantly from the default schema.
///
/// # Synchronization
///
/// [`SqlDataSource`] implements [`VersionedDataSource`](super::VersionedDataSource), which means
/// changes are applied to the underlying database via transactions. [`Transaction`] maps exactly to
/// a transaction in the underling RDBMS, and inherits the underlying concurrency semantics.
///
/// # Extension and Composition
///
/// [`SqlDataSource`] is designed to be both extensible (so you can add additional state to the API
/// modules defined in this crate) and composable (so you can use [`SqlDataSource`] as one component
/// of a larger state type for an application with additional modules).
///
/// ## Extension
///
/// It is possible to add additional, application-specific state to [`SqlDataSource`]. If the new
/// state should live in memory, simply wrap the [`SqlDataSource`] in an
/// [`ExtensibleDataSource`](super::ExtensibleDataSource):
///
/// ```
/// # use hotshot_query_service::data_source::{
/// #   sql::{Config, Error}, ExtensibleDataSource, SqlDataSource,
/// # };
/// # use hotshot_query_service::fetching::provider::NoFetching;
/// # use hotshot_query_service::testing::mocks::MockTypes as AppTypes;
/// # async fn doc(config: Config) -> Result<(), Error> {
/// type AppState = &'static str;
///
/// let data_source: ExtensibleDataSource<SqlDataSource<AppTypes, NoFetching>, AppState> =
///     ExtensibleDataSource::new(config.connect(NoFetching).await?, "app state");
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// The [`ExtensibleDataSource`](super::ExtensibleDataSource) wrapper implements all the same data
/// source traits as [`SqlDataSource`], and also provides access to the `AppState` parameter for use
/// in API endpoint handlers. This can be used to implement an app-specific data source trait and
/// add a new API endpoint that uses this app-specific data, as described in the
/// [extension guide](crate#extension).
///
/// If the new application-specific state should live in the SQL database itself, the implementation
/// is more involved, but still possible. Follow the steps for [custom
/// migrations](#custom-migrations) to modify the database schema to account for the new data you
/// want to store. You can then access this data through the [`SqlDataSource`] using
/// [`read`](super::VersionedDataSource::read) to run a custom read-only SQL query or
/// [`write`](super::VersionedDataSource::write) to execute a custom atomic mutation of the
/// database.
///
/// ## Composition
///
/// Composing [`SqlDataSource`] with other module states is fairly simple -- just
/// create an aggregate struct containing both [`SqlDataSource`] and your additional module
/// states, as described in the [composition guide](crate#composition). If the additional modules
/// have data that should live in the same database as the [`SqlDataSource`] data, you can follow
/// the steps in [custom migrations](#custom-migrations) to accommodate this.
