//! Persistent storage for data sources.
//!
//! Naturally, an archival query service such as this is heavily dependent on a persistent storage
//! implementation. This module defines the interfaces required of this storage. Any storage layer
//! implementing the appropriate interfaces can be used as the storage layer when constructing a
//! [`FetchingDataSource`](super::FetchingDataSource), which can in turn be used to instantiate the
//! REST APIs provided by this crate.
//!
//! This module also comes with a few pre-built persistence implementations:
//! * [`SqlStorage`]
//! * [`FileSystemStorage`]
//!
//! # Storage Traits vs Data Source Traits
//!
//! Many of the traits defined in this module (e.g. [`NodeStorage`], [`ExplorerStorage`], and
//! others) are nearly identical to the corresponding data source traits (e.g.
//! [`NodeDataSource`](crate::node::NodeDataSource),
//! [`ExplorerDataSource`](crate::explorer::ExplorerDataSource), etc). They typically differ in
//! mutability: the storage traits are intended to be implemented on storage
//! [transactions](super::Transaction), and because even reading may update the internal
//! state of a transaction, such as a buffer or database cursor, these traits typically take `&mut
//! self`. This is not a barrier for concurrency since there may be many transactions open
//! simultaneously from a single data source. The data source traits, meanwhile, are implemented on
//! the data source itself. Internally, they usually open a fresh transaction and do all their work
//! on the transaction, not modifying the data source itself, so they take `&self`.
//!
//! For traits that differ _only_ in the mutability of the `self` parameter, it is almost possible
//! to combine them into a single trait whose methods take `self` by value, and implementing said
//! traits for the reference types `&SomeDataSource` and `&mut SomeDataSourceTransaction`. There are
//! two problems with this approach, which lead us to prefer the slight redundance of having
//! separate versions of the traits with mutable and immutable methods:
//! * The trait bounds quickly get out of hand, since we now have trait bounds not only on the type
//!   itself, but also on references to that type, and the reference also requires the introduction
//!   of an additional lifetime parameter.
//! * We run into a longstanding [`rustc` bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/85063) in
//!   which type inference diverges when given trait bounds on reference types, even when
//!   theoretically the types are uniquely inferable. This issue can be worked around by [explicitly
//!   specifying type parameters at every call site](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/type-recursion-when-trait-bound-is-added-on-reference-type/74525/2),
//!   but this further exacerbates the ergonomic issues with this approach, past the point of
//!   viability.
//!
//! Occasionally, there may be further differences between the data source traits and corresponding
//! storage traits. For example, [`AvailabilityStorage`] also differs from
//! [`AvailabilityDataSource`](crate::availability::AvailabilityDataSource) in fallibility.
//!

/// This trait defines the interface which must be provided by the storage layer in order to
/// implement an availability data source. It is very similar to
/// [`AvailabilityDataSource`](crate::availability::AvailabilityDataSource) with every occurrence of
/// [`Fetch`](crate::availability::Fetch) replaced by [`QueryResult`]. This is not a coincidence.
/// The purpose of the storage layer is to provide all of the functionality of the data source
/// layer, but independent of an external fetcher for missing data. Thus, when the storage layer
/// encounters missing, corrupt, or inaccessible data, it simply gives up and replaces the missing
/// data with [`Err`], rather than creating an asynchronous fetch request to retrieve the missing
/// data.
///
/// Rust gives us ways to abstract and deduplicate these two similar APIs, but they do not lead to a
/// better interface.
