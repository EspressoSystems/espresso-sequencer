//! Multi-producer, multi-consumer oneshot notification channel
//!
//! [`Notifier`] is an asynchronous, multi-producer, multi-consumer, oneshot channel satisfying
//! three additional requirements:
//! 1. Dropped receivers do not consume resources.
//! 2. Messages are not copied for receivers who don't want them.
//! 3. Minimal resource contention for concurrent subscriptions.
//!
//! ## Dropped receivers do not consume resources
//!
//! This requirement is a direct prerequisite of the broader requirement that passive requests for
//! resources do not consume resources. This is important because in general, passive requests may
//! be for resources that are not guaranteed to exist, and thus may never terminate. Just like we
//! avoid spawning a task for passive requests, since it may never complete, we need receivers for
//! passive requests not to persist beyond the lifetime of the request, or they may never be closed.
//!
//! This requirement is implemented via garbage collection: each time a message is sent, resources
//! belonging to dropped receivers are cleaned up. Thus, strictly speaking, dropped receivers do
//! consume resources, but only briefly. There is no need to keep them around until the desired
//! message is delivered, for example.
//!
//! ## Messages are not copied for receivers who don't want them.
//!
//! The second requirement simplifies the higher level fetching logic by allowing us to maintain a
//! single channel for all notifications about a particular resource type, rather than separate
//! channels for each specific request. Since messages are not copied for all subscribers, but only
//! for the subscribers interested in a particular message, this simplification becomes nearly
//! cost-free.
//!
//! This requirement is implemented by attaching a predicate to each subscription, which takes a
//! message by reference. The predicate is checked on the sending side, and the message is only
//! copied to the subscription if the predicate is satisfied.
//!
//! ## Minimal resource contention for concurrent subscriptions.
//!
//! This is important because subscriptions are requested in response to read-only client requests,
//! which are supposed to run in parallel as much as possible. By contrast, notifications are
//! usually send from internal server tasks (e.g. the background task that updates the data source
//! when new blocks are committed). It is less of a problem if these internal tasks contend with
//! each other, because they are not directly blocking responses to clients, and we have more
//! control over how and when they acquire shared resources.
//!
//! This requirement also empowers us to create a simpler design for the high-level fetching logic.
//! Specifically, we can reuse the same code for fetching individual resources as we use for
//! long-lived subscription streams (e.g. `subscribe_blocks` is a thin wrapper around
//! `get_block_range`). We do not have to worry about adding complex logic to reuse notification
//! subscriptions for long-lived streams, because subscribing anew for each entry in the stream has
//! low overhead in terms of contention over shared resources -- the dominant caused in any
//! concurrent channel, after data copying (see above).
//!
//! This further lets us simplify the interface of this channel a bit: since all notifications are
//! oneshot, consumers deal with futures rather than streams.
//!
//! This requirement is satisfied by maintaining the list of subscribers to a [`Notifier`] in a way
//! that moves most resource contention to message senders, rather than receivers. We make the
//! assumption that there is less concurrency among senders. In the common case, there is just one
//! sender: the task monitoring HotShot for new blocks. Occasionally, there may be other tasks
//! spawned to fetch missing resources and send them through the [`Notifier`], but these should be
//! relatively few and rare.

    // When a new subscriber joins the subscriber set, they do not immediately add themselves to
    // `active`. Instead, they simply send themselves to this channel. Every time a message is sent,
    // it will drain pending subscribers from here and add them to `active`. In this way, almost all
    // of the cost is paid by senders, rather than receivers, and receivers do not contend with
    // senders. We adopt this design for
    // two reasons:
    // 1. Most basically, more messages are received than sent, since the intended use of this
    //    channel is broadcast, with each message being delivered to multiple receivers. Thus,
    //    moving cost from receivers to senders is always good.
    // 2. This channel is intended to be highly concurrent, and `active` is a shared resource that
    //    is ripe for contention. With this design, _only_ sends contend for a lock on the
    //    subscribers list, but new subscriptions do not. Again, since there are often more
    //    receivers than senders, this can reduce contention significantly.
    // Consider the example use case of `Fetcher::fetching_stream`. This design of the notification
    // channel lets us go with a very simple design of fetching stream, where we fetch each
    // subsequent entry individually, with a one-shot notification future. This pattern leads to
    // many concurrent subscription requests: each time a new entry is produced, every open stream
    // will subscribe anew to notifications for the next entry, at the same time. However, these
    // concurrent subscriptions go through the high-throughput multi-producer stream implementation,
    // and do not contend for the lock on `FilterSender::subscribers`.
