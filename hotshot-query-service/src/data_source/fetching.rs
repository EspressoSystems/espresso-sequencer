//! Asynchronous retrieval of missing data.
//!
//! [`FetchingDataSource`] combines a local storage implementation with a remote data availability
//! provider to create a data sources which caches data locally, but which is capable of fetching
//! missing data from a remote source, either proactively or on demand.
//!
//! This implementation supports three kinds of data fetching.
//!
//! # Proactive Fetching
//!
//! Proactive fetching means actively scanning the local database for missing objects and
//! proactively retrieving them from a remote provider, even if those objects have yet to be
//! requested by a client. Doing this increases the chance of success and decreases latency when a
//! client does eventually ask for those objects. This is also the mechanism by which a query
//! service joining a network late, or having been offline for some time, is able to catch up with
//! the events on the network that it missed.
//!
//! The current implementation of proactive fetching is meant to be the simplest effective algorithm
//! which still gives us a reasonable range of configuration options for experimentation. It is
//! subject to change as we learn about the behavior of proactive fetching in a realistic system.
//!
//! Proactive fetching is currently implemented by a background task which performs periodic scans
//! of the database, identifying and retrieving missing objects. This task is generally low
//! priority, since missing objects are rare, and it will take care not to monopolize resources that
//! could be used to serve requests. To reduce load and to optimize for the common case where blocks
//! are usually not missing once they have already been retrieved, we distinguish between _major_
//! and _minor_ scans.
//!
//! Minor scans are lightweight and can run very frequently. They will only look for missing
//! blocks among blocks that are new since the previous scan. Thus, the more frequently minor
//! scans run, the less work they have to do. This allows them to run frequently, giving low
//! latency for retrieval of newly produced blocks that we failed to receive initially. Between
//! each minor scan, the task will sleep for [a configurable
//! duration](Builder::with_minor_scan_interval) to wait for new blocks to be produced and give
//! other tasks full access to all shared resources.
//!
//! Every `n`th scan (`n` is [configurable](Builder::with_major_scan_interval)) is a major scan.
//! These scan all blocks from 0, which guarantees that we will eventually retrieve all blocks, even
//! if for some reason we have lost a block that we previously had (due to storage failures and
//! corruptions, or simple bugs in this software). These scans are rather expensive (although they
//! will release control of shared resources many times during the duration of the scan), but
//! because it is rather unlikely that a major scan will discover any missing blocks that the next
//! minor scan would have missed, it is ok if major scans run very infrequently.
//!
//! # Active Fetching
//!
//! Active fetching means reaching out to a remote data availability provider to retrieve a missing
//! resource, upon receiving a request for that resource from a client. Not every request for a
//! missing resource triggers an active fetch. To avoid spamming peers with requests for missing
//! data, we only actively fetch resources that are known to exist somewhere. This means we can
//! actively fetch leaves and headers when we are requested a leaf or header by height, whose height
//! is less than the current chain height. We can fetch a block when the corresponding header exists
//! (corresponding based on height, hash, or payload hash) or can be actively fetched.
//!
//! # Passive Fetching
//!
//! For requests that cannot be actively fetched (for example, a block requested by hash, where we
//! do not have a header proving that a block with that hash exists), we use passive fetching. This
//! essentially means waiting passively until the query service receives an object that satisfies
//! the request. This object may be received because it was actively fetched in responsive to a
//! different request for the same object, one that permitted an active fetch. Or it may have been
//! fetched [proactively](#proactive-fetching).
