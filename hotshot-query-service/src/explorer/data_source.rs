/// concerning the blockchain from the stored data for use with a
/// block explorer.  It does not provide the same guarantees as the
/// Availability data source with data fetching.  It is not concerned with
/// being up-to-date or having all of the data required, but rather it is
/// concerned with providing the requested data as quickly as possible, and in
/// a way that can be easily cached.
