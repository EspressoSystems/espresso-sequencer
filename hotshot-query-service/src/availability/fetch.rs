/// An in-progress request to fetch some data.
///
/// A [`Fetch`] represents the period of uncertainty after some data has been requested, before it
/// is known whether that data exists locally or must be retrieved from an external source (or
/// whether we must wait for the data to be created in the first place).
///
/// For data that is already available locally, a request for that data may return [`Fetch::Ready`]
/// with the data itself. Otherwise, the request will return [`Fetch::Pending`] with a future that
/// will resolve once the data is available.
///
/// Depending on the context, [`Fetch`] can behave a bit like a [`Future`](futures::Future) or a bit
/// like a [`Result`]. Therefore, it implements [`IntoFuture`], so it can be awaited (this is the
/// same as calling [`resolve`](Self::resolve)) and it implements methods [`context`](Self::context)
/// and [`with_context`](Self::with_context), which make it easy to convert a [`Fetch`] to a
/// [`Result`], mimicking the methods from Snafu traits [`OptionExt`](snafu::OptionExt) and
