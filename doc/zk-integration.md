# Integration with ZK rollups

## Background

> For more context and terminology about the architecture of Espresso, please read [README.md](../README.md).

At a high level ZK rollups produce blocks and periodically settle their new state on layer 1 (e.g. Ethereum), after
applying all the transactions of such blocks to their current state. The time between two consecutive updates can vary,
yet it is high enough in order to amortize gas costs for the rollup and thus offer low fees to end users. ZK rollups
have the option to participate in Espresso's marketplace for rollup sequencers. This marketplace can produce blocks
simultaneously for multiple rollups. In this context each rollup assigns itself an identifier called a _namespace_. Each
rollup uses its namespace identifier to extract its own rollup-specific transactions from the Espresso ledger, along
with a succinct proof of inclusion of these transactions in the Espresso ledger. Participation in the Espresso
marketplace has many benefits for rollups, which we discuss
[elsewhere](https://hackmd.io/@EspressoSystems/market-design) . In this document we focus on how a zk rollup might
integrate with the Espresso marketplace.

## Integration approaches

Similarly to their optimistic alternatives, ZK rollups need to instantiate their derivation pipeline in order to
integrate with Espresso. There are a number of alternatives for such integration, depending on specific constraints the
rollup may have, such as using a particular data availability layer in addition to Tiramisu, or the need to update their
state on the L1 at a faster pace than the Espresso light client contract does.

As described in the [sequence diagram](../README.md#Architecture), ZK rollups relying on Espresso blocks as their source
of transactions have to prove their state update is consistent with the Espresso state. This can be achieved in two
ways:

1. The rollup relies on the Espresso light client contract to fetch the Espresso state updates.
2. The rollup verifies some value equivalent to the Espresso finality gadget inside its circuit.

Moreover, in case the Espresso consensus loses liveness, and thus the corresponding finality gadget is not available,
the rollup can fall back to a backup sequencer. In order to reliably detect that the Espresso consensus is not making
progress, the rollup contract will call an escape hatch function part of the Espresso light client contract.

For both alternatives we describe:

- the high level structure of the circuit as well as the rollup L1 contract and how they are related.
- how rollups use the escape hatch function of the Espresso light client contract to source the transactions from the
  backup sequencer.

For rollups relying exclusively on a centralized sequencer (such as most current production deployments today), the
circuit only checks the correct update of the zkVM as depicted in Figure 1. Naturally this same circuit can be used when
the escape hatch is activated, as in this case the backup sequencer is in control of the rollup operator. When the
escape hatch is not activated, because the Espresso consensus is making progress, the circuit depicted in Figure 1 needs
to be extended with additional gadgets in order to guarantee the transactions are fetched from the Espresso ledger
instead of some trusted / local source.

**Figure 1:** Circuit used when the rollup falls back to using its default (centralized) sequencer. The public inputs
are the current state of the rollup `cm_state_vm i`, the new rollup state after update `cm_state_vm i+1` and a
commitment to the transactions applied to the state, `cm_txs_rollup`. The private input (in bold) corresponds to the
list of transactions.

## Rollup Contract

Each zk rollup already has its own contract on the L1 (Ethereum) that allows the rollup to settle its state to the L1
via verification of a snark proof. The abstract version of this contract is sketched below. In addition to contract
variables and a constructor, it contains a function `isEscapeHatchActivated` which allows to detect whether the Espresso
consensus protocol is live or not. In case liveness is lost, the rollup can update its state without reading from the
Espresso ledger by calling the function `updateStateDefaultSequencingMode`. Note that the Espresso state is read from
the Espresso light client contract which is referenced by the rollup contract via the variable `lcContract`.

```solidity
// Abstract rollup contract
contract RollupContract {

    VMState previousVMState;
    uint256 lastEspressoBlockNumber;
    LightClient lcContract;
    bytes[] vkRollup; // This verification key corresponds to the circuit depicted in Figure 1.
    bytes[] vkEspresso; // This verification key corresponds to the circuits depicted in Figure 2 or 3.
    uint256 escapeHatchThreshold; // Number of L1 blocks the Espresso light client contract is allowed to lag behind in order to consider the Espresso consensus is still live.

    constructor(address EspressoLightClientAddress,...) public {
        lcContract = LightClient(EspressoLightClientAddress);
        ...
    }

    /// Detects if the escape hatch is activated or not.
    function isEscapeHatchActivated() private returns (bool) {
        if (lcContract.getFinalizedState().blockHeight > lastEspressoBlockNumber){
            return false;
        } else {
            return lcContract.lagOverEscapeHatchThreshold(block.number, escapeHatchThreshold);
        }
    }

    /// Updates the state of the rollup if the Espresso finality gadget loses liveness.
    function updateStateBackupSequencingMode(commTxsRollup, newVMState,snarkProof) virtual {
      bytes[] publicInputs = [
        previousVMState,
        newVMState,
        commTxsRollup,
      ];

      SnarkVerify(
        publicInputs,
        snarkProof,
        vkRollup);

      previousVMState = newVMState;
    }


    // Update the rollup state using the Espresso ledger as input.
    function updateStateFromEspresso(
        currentEspressoState,
        blockNumberEspresso,
        commTxsRollup,
        newVMState,
        snarkProof) virtual {

        if (blockNumberEspresso <= lastBlockNumberEspresso) {
          revert();
        }

        bytes[] publicInputs = [
          previousVMState,
          newVMState,
          commTxsRollup,
          currentEspressoState,
          lastEspressoBlockNumber,
          blockNumberEspresso
        ];

        SnarkVerify(
          publicInputs,
          snarkProof,
          vkEspresso
        );

        lastBlockNumberEspresso =  blockNumberEspresso;

        previousVMState = newVMState;
    }

    // Main function to update the rollup state. Specific to the type of integration (see below)
    function updateRollupState(...
        ){
        ...
    }
}
```

## Integration 1: Rollup contract fetches Espresso block commitment from the Espresso light client contract

For this integration, Espresso consensus verification is delegated to the Espresso light client contract. In practice
the rollup contract will be given a Merkle root of all Espresso block commitments up to now[^1] and feed it to the
circuit. Still additional gadgets need to be introduced in order to implement the derivation pipeline logic consisting
at a high level of:

- Collecting all the Espresso blocks since last update, along with proofs of membership for their commitments in the
  given Merkle root.
- Filtering each of these Espresso blocks to gather all the transactions belonging to the rollups.
- Establishing some equivalence between the commitment to the rollup transactions used in the zkVM and those same
  transactions obtained after namespace filtering.

![image](zk-rollup-circuit-no-espresso-consensus.svg) **Figure 2:** Rollup circuit with additional gadgets _Espresso
Derivation_. Private inputs of the circuit are written in uppercase and bold font.

The circuit depicted in Figure 2 operates as follows:

- The _Espresso Derivation_ gadget receives as public inputs a `blk_cm_root` which is the Merkle root of all finalized
  Espresso block commitments up to now, and a commitment of transactions `cm_txs_rollup` that is used by _zkVM_ gadget.
  With witnesses of all transactions to the rollup `ROLLUP_TXS` and proofs that they are complete and correctly filtered
  from finalized Espresso blocks since last update `TXS_NAMESPACE_PROOFS`, it checks that:
  - Namespace proofs `TXS_NAMESPACE_PROOFS` are valid, saying that `ROLLUP_TXS` are complete and correctly filtered from
    Espresso blockscommited in a Merkle tree with root `blk_cm_root` since last update.
  - Given `cm_txs_rollup` commits to the filtered transactions `ROLLUP_TXS`.
- The _zkVM_ gadget is the original gadget of the rollup circuit that proves a correct transition from state
  `cm_state_vm i` to the next state `cm_state_vm i+1` when applying the transactions represented by the commitment value
  `cm_txs_rollup`.
- These three gadgets above return a boolean: true if the verification succeeds and false otherwise.
- For the circuit to accept, all these gadget outputs must be true, and thus we add an _AND_ gate.

Please read [our doc](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/zkrollup-integration) for more detailed description along with
a reference implementation.[^2]

The pseudocode of the rollup contract below shows that in the case we rely on the Espresso light client contract to
fetch the Espresso state, the only inputs to the function `updateRollupState` are `newVMState`, `commTxsRollup` and
`snarkProof`.

```solidity
/// Uses the Espresso light client contract to fetch the last state.
contract RollupContract1 is RollupContract {

    function updateRollupState(
        newVMState,
        commTxsRollup,
        snarkProof){

        // Escape hatch is activated, switch to default sequencing mode
        if (isEscapeHatchActivated()){
            this.updateStateBackupSequencingMode(commTxsRollup,newVMState,snarkProof);
        } else { // No escape hatch, use the state of Espresso consensus
            lightClientState = lcContract.getFinalizedState();
            currentEspressoState = lightClientState.blockCommRoot;
            blockNumberEspresso = lightClientState.blockHeight;
            this.updateStateFromEspresso(currentEspressoState, blockNumberEspresso, commTxsRollup, newVMState, snarkProof);
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration 2: Verify Espresso consensus inside the rollup circuit

![image](zk-rollup-circuit.svg) **Figure 3:** Rollup circuit with additional gadgets _Espresso Consensus_ and _Espresso
Derivation_. Private inputs of the circuit are written in uppercase and bold font.

The circuit depicted in Figure 3 operates as follows:

- The _Espresso Consensus_ gadget checks the Merkle root of Espresso block commitments `blk_cm_root` using the
  multi-signature `STATE_SIGS` obtained by the HotShot replicas. To achieve this goal, it is required to obtain the
  stake table from the previous HotShot epoch `STAKE_TABLE_ENTRIES` as witness, containing the list of public keys with
  their respective stake. It can be linked to some old blocks from last epoch committed in the `blk_cm_root` via the
  witness `STAKE_TABLE_OPENINGS`. Finally, note that the first `blk_cm_root` value needs to be read from the light
  client contract. Afterward, no dependency on the light client contract is needed.
- The other gadgets are the same as in Integration 1.

The pseudocode of the rollup contract below shows that in the case we do not rely on the Espresso light client contract
to fetch the Espresso state, the function `updateRollupState` requires additional inputs (compared to Integration 1)
which are `currentEspressoState` and `blockNumberEspresso`.

```solidity

/// Does not use the Espresso Light client contract for fetching the Espresso state
contract RollupContract2 is RollupContract {

  function updateRollupState(
    currentEspressoState,
    blockNumberEspresso,
    newVMState,
    commTxsRollup,
    snarkProof){

    // Escape hatch is activated, switch to default sequencing mode
    if (isEscapeHatchActivated()){
      this.updateStateBackupSequencingMode(commTxsRollup,newVMState,snarkProof);
    } else { // No escape hatch, use the state of Espresso consensus
      this.updateStateFromEspresso(currentEspressoState, blockNumberEspresso, commTxsRollup, newVMState, snarkProof);
    }
  }
}
```

    Note that the rollup state is updated at a much lower frequency (in the order of minutes / hours) than the Espresso
    state (in the order of seconds).
