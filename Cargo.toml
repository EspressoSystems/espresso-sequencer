#
# This feature allows unit tests to print out a backtrace if they overflow their stack. The
# implementation may trigger undefined behavior, so it is only used in tests and requires its own
# separate feature flag; it is not enabled just by using the "testing" feature.
#
# This feature is not supported on Windows because it uses Unix-style signal handling to catch
# stack overflow exceptions.
