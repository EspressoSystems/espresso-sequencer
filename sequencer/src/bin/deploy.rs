/// to configure the sequencer network are ESPRESSO_SEQUENCER_HOTSHOT_ADDRESS and
/// ESPRESSO_SEQUENCER_LIGHT_CLIENT_PROXY_ADDRESS. These contracts, however, have dependencies, and

/// deployed and we only need to deploy the other one.

/// addresses will be used in place of deploying a new contract wherever that contract is required
/// in the deployment process. The generated .env file will include all the addresses passed in as
