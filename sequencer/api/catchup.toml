Get the fee account balance for `address`.

This endpoint can be used to catch up to the current state from a recent state by fetching the
balance (with proof) at the given block `:height` and `:view` number. `:height` and `:view` _must_
correspond! `:height` is provided to simplify lookups for backends where data is not indexed by
view.

This endpoint is intended to be used for catchup, so `:view` should be no older than the last
decided view.

Returns the account balance and a Merkle proof relative to the fee state root at the requested
height and view. If there is no entry for this account in the requested fee state (note: this is
distinct from the server _not knowing_ the entry for this account), the returned balance is 0 and
the proof is a Merkle _non-membership_ proof.

Bulk version of `/:height/:view/account`. The request body should be a JSON array consisting of

The response is a `FeeMerkleTree` containing sub-trees for each of the requested accounts, which is

`:height` is provided to simplify lookups for backends where data is not indexed by view.

This endpoint retrieves the chain config from a peer that matches the specified `:commitment`.

This can happen if the node missed a protocol upgrade.

Returns the chain config -- this includes parameters such as `max_block_size`, `chain_id`, `base_fee`, and `fee_recipient`.
